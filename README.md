# LLM Project Playground

This repository will be a collection of hands-on projects designed to deepen my understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). I plan to use each project to explore different aspects of LLMs, ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques.

Since Iâ€™m working with a single NVIDIA RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM), all projects will be optimized for local execution, utilizing compact models and efficient methods to balance performance and feasibility.

As I continue learning, I will expand this repository with new ideas, implementations, and insights, documenting my progress along the way.
